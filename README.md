# Overview

Welcome to my analysis of the data job market, focusing on data analyst roles. This project was created out of a desire to navigate and understand the job market more effectively. It delves into the top-paying and in-demand skills to help find optimal job opportunities for data analysts.

The data sourced from [Luke Barousse's Python Course](https://lukebarousse.com/python) which provides a foundation for my analysis, containing detailed information on job titles, salaries, locations, and essential skills. Through a series of Python scripts, I explore key questions such as the most demanded skills, salary trends, and the intersection of demand and salary in data analytics.

# The Questions

Below are the questions I want to answer in my project:

1. What are the skills most in demand for the top 3 most popular data roles?
2. How are in-demand skills trending for Data Analysts?
3. How well do jobs and skills pay for Data Analysts?
4. What are the optimal skills for data analysts to learn? (High Demand AND High Paying) 

# Tools I Used

For my deep dive into the data analyst job market, I harnessed the power of several key tools:

- **Python:** The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to analyze the data and find critical insights.I also used the following Python libraries:
    - **Pandas Library:** This was used to analyze the data. 
    - **Matplotlib Library:** I visualized the data.
    - **Seaborn Library:** Helped me create more advanced visuals. 
- **Jupyter Notebooks:** The tool I used to run my Python scripts which let me easily include my notes and analysis.

# Data Preparation and Cleanup

This section outlines the steps taken to prepare the data for analysis, ensuring accuracy and usability.

## Import & Clean Up Data

I start by importing necessary libraries and loading the dataset, followed by initial data cleaning tasks to ensure data quality.

```python
# Importing Libraries
import ast
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
from datasets import load_dataset
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  

# Loading Data
dataset = load_dataset('lukebarousse/data_jobs')
df = dataset['train'].to_pandas()

# Data Cleanup
df['job_posted_date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['job_posted_date'])
df['job_skills'] = df['job_skills'].apply(lambda x: ast.literal_eval(x) if pd.notna(x) else x)
```

## Filter Serbia Jobs

To focus my analysis on the Serbia job market, I apply filters to the dataset, narrowing down to roles based in Serbia.

```python
df_Serbia = df[df['job_country'] == 'Serbia']

```

# The Analysis

Each Jupyter notebook for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data job market. Hereâ€™s how I approached each question:

## 1. What are the most demanded skills for the top 3 most popular data roles?

To find the most demanded skills for the top 3 most popular data roles. I filtered out those positions by which ones were the most popular, and got the top 5 skills for these top 3 roles. This query highlights the most popular job titles and their top skills, showing which skills I should pay attention to depending on the role I'm targeting. 

View my notebook with detailed steps here: [2_Skills_Demand](3_Project\2_Skills_Demand.ipynb).

### Visualize Data

```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots(len(job_titles), 1)


for i, job_title in enumerate(job_titles):
    df_plot = df_skills_perc[df_skills_perc['job_title_short'] == job_title].head(5)[::-1]
    sns.barplot(data=df_plot, x='skill_percent', y='job_skills', ax=ax[i], hue='skill_count', palette='dark:b_r')

plt.show()
```

### Results

- Python is a versatile skill, highly demanded across all three roles, but most prominently for Data Scientists (48%) and Data Engineers (60%).

## 2. How are in-demand skills trending for Data Analysts?

To find how skills are trending in 2023 for Data Analysts, I filtered data analyst positions and grouped the skills by the month of the job postings. This got me the top 5 skills of data analysts by month, showing how popular skills were throughout 2023.

View my notebook with detailed steps here: [3_Skills_Trend](3_Skills_Trend.ipynb).

### Visualize Data

```python

from matplotlib.ticker import PercentFormatter

df_plot = df_DA_Serbia_percent.iloc[:, :5]
sns.lineplot(data=df_plot, dashes=False, legend='full', palette='tab10')

plt.gca().yaxis.set_major_formatter(PercentFormatter(decimals=0))

plt.show()

```

### Results

- Both Python and Tableau show relatively stable demand throughout the year with some fluctuations but remain essential skills for data analysts. Power BI, while less demanded compared to the others, shows a slight upward trend towards the year's end.

## 3. How well do jobs and skills pay for Data Analysts?

To identify the highest-paying roles and skills, I only got jobs in Serbia and looked at their median salary. But first I looked at the salary distributions of common data jobs like Data Scientist, Data Engineer, and Data Analyst, to get an idea of which jobs are paid the most. 

View my notebook with detailed steps here: [4_Salary_Analysis](4_Salary_Analysis.ipynb).

#### Visualize Data 

```python
sns.boxplot(data=df_Serbia_top6, x='salary_year_avg', y='job_title_short', order=job_order)

ticks_x = plt.FuncFormatter(lambda y, pos: f'${int(y/1000)}K')
plt.gca().xaxis.set_major_formatter(ticks_x)
plt.show()

```

#### Results
